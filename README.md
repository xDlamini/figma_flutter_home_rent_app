User Interface: The app features a user interface designed using Flutter and based on a Figma prototype.
Functionality: While the app currently lacks functionality, future plans include implementing features for navigating through the app.
Styling: The styling of the app is a work in progress. As I continue to learn Flutter and UI design, I'll be refining the styling to improve the overall look and feel of the app.
